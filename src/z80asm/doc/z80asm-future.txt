                z80asm - Z80 module assembler, linker, librarian

   z80asm is part of the [1]z88dk project and is used as the back-end of the
   z88dk C compilers. It is not to be confused with other non-z88dk related
   projects with the same name.

   z80asm is a relocatable assembler, linker and librarian that can assemble
   Intel 8080/8085 and [2]Z80 -family assembly files into a relocatable
   object format, can manage sets of object files in libraries and can build
   binary images by linking these object files together. The binary images
   can be defined in different sections, to match the target architecture.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [36](top) [37](keywords) [38](index)

    2.2.1. -atoctal (at is octal prefix)

   By default the at-character (@) is used as a binary number prefix.

   With the option [-atoctal](#2_2_1) it is used as the octal number prefix
   instead.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [39](top) [40](keywords) [41](index)

    2.2.2. -dotdirective (period is directive prefix)

   By default the period (.) is used to signal that the next identifier is a
   label.

   With the option [-dotdirective](#2_2_2) it is used instead to signal that
   the next identifier is an assembler directive.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [42](top) [43](keywords) [44](index)

    2.2.3. -hashhex (hash is hex prefix)

   By default the hash-character (#) is used to signal that the next
   expression should be compiled as an immediate value. This meaning,
   although common in assemblers, is a no-operation in z80asm.

   With the option [-hashhex](#2_2_3) the hash-character is used as the
   hexadecimal number prefix instead.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [45](top) [46](keywords) [47](index)

    2.2.4. -labelcol1 (labels at column 1)

   By default z80asm needs either a period (.) prefix (but see
   [-dotdirective](#2_2_2)) or a colon (:) suffix to signal that an
   identifier is a label, and white space at the beginning of a line is not
   significant.

   With the option [-labelcol1](#2_2_4) an identifier is a label if started
   at column 1, or a directive or opcode if started after white space.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [48](top) [49](keywords) [50](index)

    2.2.5. -ucase (upper case)

   By default z80asm is case-sensitive for identifiers, but case-insensitive
   for assembly keywords (opcodes, directives, registers and flags).

   The option [-ucase](#2_2_5) causes z80asm to convert all the symbols to
   upper-case, so that code that assumes case-insensitivity can be assembled.

    2.3.1. -noprec (no precedence in expression evaluation)

   By default z80asm follows the C-precedence rules while evaluating
   expressions:

   Precedence Operators               Description               Associativity

   12         &&         Logical AND                            left-to-right
   13         ^^         Logical XOR                            left-to-right
   14         ||         Logical OR                             left-to-right
   15         ?:         Ternary conditional                    right-to-left

   With the [-noprec](#2_3_1) expressions are evaluated strictly
   left-to-right.

3. Input Files

   z80asm reads text files in the syntax supported by the specific processor
   being assembled for (see [-mCPU](#2_4_1) option) and produces the
   corresponding object files.

   An input file with a .o extension is assumed to be already in object file
   format and is just read by the linker. Any other extension is considered
   an assembly source file (conventionally .asm).

   A project list file may be supplied in the command line prefixed by the
   at-sign (e.g. @project.lst). The list file contains one input file name
   per line, or another project list prefixed with an at-sign, which is
   opened recursively. Hash signs (#) and semi-colons (;) may be used at the
   start of lines in the list files to include comments.

   Both the command line and the list files support wild-cards to expand all
   the files that match the given pattern.

   Note that the Operating System may do its own wildcard expansion and the
   pattern may need to be quoted in the command line.

   A single star in a file name (*) expands to the list of all
   files/directories that match the complete pattern, where the star
   represents any sequence of characters. A double-star in a directory name
   (**) expands to the complete directory sub-tree, when searched
   recursively.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [90](top) [91](keywords) [92](index)

  3.1. Source File Format

   The assembler parses source files with any of the common end-of-line
   termination sequences ("\r", "\n" or "\r\n"). Each line starts with an
   optional label and can contain assembly directives (i.e. instructions to
   the assembler), assembly instructions (i.e. code to be translated into
   object code for the specific processor) or blanks and comments.

   A single backslash character (\) may be used to separate multiple
   statements in a single line.

 org 0                     ; assembly directive
 start: push bc\pop hl     ; define a label and add two assembly opcodes
 ret                       ; assembly opcode can be at the first column

   Differently to most other assemblers, white space is not significant, i.e.
   a label can be defined after white space, and an opcode can be written at
   column 1 (but see option [-labelcol1](#2_2_4)).

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [93](top) [94](keywords) [95](index)

  3.2. Comments

   Comments may start with a semi-colon (;) or two slashes (//) and end at
   the end of the line, or may start with slash-star (/*) and end with
   star-slash (*/), possibly spanning multiple lines.

 ld a, 1                   ; this is a comment
 ld b, 2                   // another comment
 ld c, /* multi-line comment is valid
          in the middle of an instruction
       */ 3                ; C = 3

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [96](top) [97](keywords) [98](index)

  3.3. Symbols

   All symbols in the code (labels, variables, ...) are named with unique
   identifiers. Identifiers start with a letter or underscore (_), and can
   contain letters, digits, underscores or periods (.). Identifiers are
   case-sensitive (but see option [-ucase](#2_2_5)).

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [99](top) [100](keywords) [101](index)

  3.4. Labels

   A label is a symbol that represents the current assembly address (ASMPC)
   and is defined at the start of a line by prefixing a symbol with a period
   (.) (but see [-dotdirective](#2_2_2)) or suffixing it with a colon (:),
   i.e. either .label or label: (but see [-labelcol1](#2_2_4)).

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [102](top) [103](keywords) [104](index)

  3.5. Numbers

   The assembler accepts numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary.
   Different syntaxes are allowed to simplify porting code written for other
   assemblers. Some of the prefix characters are also used as operators; in
   this case a space may be needed to signal the difference, e.g.

 ld a, %10     ; A = 2 (10 binary)
 ld a, 12 % 10 ; A = 2 (remainder of 12 divided by 10)

   All expressions are computed as signed integers with the host platform's
   integer size (32-bit or 64-bit in the most common platforms). Expression
   evaluation follows the operator precedence of C (but see
   [-noprec](#2_3_1)).

   The underscore can be used to separate groups of digits to help
   readability, e.g. 0xFFFF_FFFF is the same as 0xFFFFFFFF.

   Floating point numbers can be supplied with the FLOAT directive, that
   encodes them in the current floating point format in the object code.
   Floating point numbers must be supplied in decimal base and have an
   integer part and a fractional part separated by a period, followed by an
   optional e (exponent), a plus or minus sign, and the power of 10 to
   multiply to the base.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [105](top) [106](keywords) [107](index)

    3.5.1. Decimal

   Decimal numbers are a sequence of decimal digits (0..9), optionally
   followed by a d or D - all prefixes and suffixes are case-insensitive.
   Leading zeros are insignificant - note the difference from C, where a
   leading zero means octal.

 ld a, 99
 ld a, 99d

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [108](top) [109](keywords) [110](index)

    3.5.2. Hexadecimal

   Hexadecimal numbers are a sequence of hexadecimal digits (0..9 and A..F,
   case-insensitive), either prefixed or suffixed with an hexadecimal marker.
   If the marker is a suffix, and the number starts with a letter, then a
   leading zero has to be added.

   The hexadecimal prefix $ is also the ASMPC identifier if not followed by a
   hexadecimal number, i.e. the address of the instruction being assembled.

   The hexadecimal prefix # is only recognised with the option
   [-hashhex](#2_2_3).

 ld a, $FF
 ld a, #FF           ; only with option  [-hashhex](#2_2_3)
 ld a, 0xFF
 ld a, 0FFh

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [111](top) [112](keywords) [113](index)

    3.5.3. Octal

   Octal numbers are a sequence of octal digits (0..7), either prefixed or
   suffixed with an octal marker.

   The octal-prefix @ is only recognised with the option [-atoctal](#2_2_1).

 ld a, @77           ; only with option  [-atoctal](#2_2_1)
 ld a, 0o77
 ld a, 0q77
 ld a, 77o
 ld a, 77q

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [114](top) [115](keywords) [116](index)

    3.5.4. Binary

   Binary numbers are a sequence of binary digits (0..1), either prefixed or
   suffixed with a binary marker.

   The binary prefix % is also the modulus operator, if not followed by a
   binary digit.

   The binary prefix @ is recognised unless the option [-atoctal](#2_2_1) is
   given.

 ld a, %11
 ld a, @11           ; except with option  [-atoctal](#2_2_1)
 ld a, 0b11
 ld a, 11b

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [117](top) [118](keywords) [119](index)

    3.5.5. Bitmaps

   Binary numbers can be specified as bitmaps, with # as 1 and - as 0, using
   the binary prefix (@ or %) immediately followed by a double-quoted string
   of hashes and dashes.

 defb @"---##---"
 defb @"-##--##-"
 defb %"-##-----"
 defb %"-##-----"
 defb @"-##--##-"
 defb @"---##---"

  3.6. Keywords

   Processor registers (BC, DE, ...) and flags (NZ, Z, ...), and assembly
   ASMPC, representing the current assembly location, are reserved keywords.
   They cannot be used as identifiers, and are case-insensitive.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [123](top) [124](keywords) [125](index)

  3.7. Directives and Opcodes

   Assembler directives ([ORG](#10_25), [INCLUDE](#10_18), ...) and processor
   opcodes (NOP, LD, ...) are interpreted as directives or opcodes when
   appearing at the start of the statement or after a label definition, or as
   regular identifiers otherwise. The directives and opcodes are
   case-insensitive.

 jr: jr jr  ; silly example, jr is both a label and an opcode
            ; while correct code, it's confusing, don't do it

4. Object File Format

   The object and library files are stored in binary form as a set of
   contiguous sections. The files are cross-platform compatible, i.e. they
   can be created in a big-endian architecture and used in a little-endian
   one.

   The files start with a signature and a version number.

   A set of file pointers at the start of the object file point to the start
   of each section existing the in the file, or contain 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) if
   that section does not exist.

   The following object types exist in the file:

    Type   Size (bytes)                      Description
   char    1            ASCII character
   byte    1            unsigned 8-bit value
   word    2            unsigned 16-bit value, little-endian ( [129]Z80
                        /Intel)
   dword   4            signed 32-bit value, little-endian ( [130]Z80 /Intel)
   string  1+length     one byte with the string length followed by the
                        characters of the string
   lstring 2+length     one word with the string length followed by the
                        characters of the string

  4.1. Object Files

   The format of the object files is as follows:

  4.3. Format History

   Version                              Comment
   01      original z80asm version
   02      allow expressions to use standard C operators instead of the
           original (legacy) z80asm specific syntax.
           include the address of the start of the assembly instruction in
   03      the object file, so that expressions with ASMPC are correctly
           computed at link time; remove type 'X' symbols (global library),
           no longer used.
   04      include the source file location of expressions in order to give
           meaningful link-time error messages.
   05      include source code sections.
   06      incomplete implementation, fixed in version 07
           include [144]DEFC symbols that are defined as an expression using
   07      other symbols and are computed at link time, after all addresses
           are allocated.
   08      include a user defined [145]ORG address per section.
   09      include the file and line number where each symbol was defined.
   10      allow a section alignment to be defined.
   11      allow big-endian 16-bit expressions to be patched; these
           big-endian values are used in the ZXN coper unit.
   12      allow the target expression of relative jumps to be computed in
           the link phase
   13      add 8-bit signed and unsigned values extended to 16-bits
   14      add 24-bit pointers

5. z80asm Syntax

                      THE [149]Z80 CROSS ASSEMBLER (z88dk)

   Version: v2.6.1 (October 3rd, 2014)

   Thank you for purchasing a copy of this cross assembler. We have made an
   effort to program an easy user interface and efficient assembler source
   file compiling. The object file and library format is an invention of our
   own and has also been included in this documentation. We hope that you
   will enjoy your [150]Z80 machine code programming with our assembler.

   We have made an effort to produce a fairly easy-to-understand
   documentation. If you have any comments or corrections, please don't
   hesitate to contact us:

1. Running the assembler

   Since assemblers are developed for programmers the user interface have
   been implemented according to the standard command line environment (CLI)
   used in most operating systems; however, if only a GUI interface is
   available (as in MacOS) then a command shell must be executed to allow
   standard command line input. The [152]Z80 Module Assembler command line
   interface may change if other programmers wish to implement a different
   interface to the assembler. You have the opportunity!

  5.1. Help page

   When executing the assembler from the command line with the [156]-h
   option, a help page is displayed. The page shortly explains the syntax of
   parameter specification and which parameters are available.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [157](top) [158](keywords) [159](index)

  5.2. Command line

   The syntax of the assembler parameters is a straightforward design.
   Filenames or a project file are always specified. The options may be left
   out:

 z80asm [options] <filename {filename}> | <@modulesfile>

   As seen above <options> must be specified first. Then you enter the names
   of all files to be assembled. You either choose to specify all file names
   or a @<project-file> containing all file names. File name may be specified
   with or without the 'asm extension. The correct filename parsing is
   handled automatically by the assembler. As seen on the syntax at least one
   source file must be specified and may be repeated with several file names.
   Only one project file may be specified if no source file names are given.

   Many of the parameters are preset with default values which gives an easy
   user interface when specifying the assembly parameters. Only advanced
   parameters need to be specified explicitly. The help page displays the
   default parameter values at the bottom of the page.

  5.3. Command line options

   Options are used to control the assembly process and output. They are
   recognised by the assembler when you specify a leading minus before the
   option identifier ('-'). Options are always specified before file names or
   project files.

   When the assembler is executed options are all preset with default values
   and are either switched ON or OFF (active or not). All options have a
   single letter identification. Upper and lower case letters are
   distinguished, which means that 'a' might be different command than 'A'.
   If an option is to be turned off, you simply specify a 'n' before the
   identification, e.g. -nl which selects listing files not to be created by
   the assembler.

    5.3.1. -e<ext> : Use alternative source file extension

   The default assembler source file extension is ".asm". Using this option,
   you force the assembler to use another default extension, like ".opt" or
   ".as" for the source file.

   The extension is specified without the ".". Only three letters are
   accepted - the rest is discarded.

    5.3.2. -M<ext> : Use alternative object file extension

   The default assembler object file extension is ".obj". Using this option,
   you force the assembler to use another default extension, like ".o" as the
   object file name extension.

   The extension is specified without the ".". Only three letters are
   accepted - the rest is discarded.

    5.3.3. -l : Create listing file output

   The information in listing files is a combination of the original source
   file and additional information of the generated machine code. Further,
   the listing file is page formatted with a header specifying the date and
   time of the compilation, the filename of the listing and a page number.

   For each line of the source file the following information is written:

 <source file line number> <assembler address>
 <machine code hex dump> <source line>

   The machine code and assembler address output are written in hexadecimal
   notation. If the machine code uses more the 4 bytes, the source file line
   is written on the following line. This usually happens when you have
   defined a string constant or a relatively large amount of constant
   definitions.

   The assembler address is always beginning at zero, i.e. the beginning of
   the current modules' machine code. In a relocated context of the machine
   code, where all code is positioned at fixed addresses, you will have the
   opportunity to view the addresses of your code relative to the start of
   individual modules using the assembler output addresses. Further, the last
   assembler address can be interpreted as the size of the modules' generated
   machine code.

   Listing files also serves the purpose of a hard copy on paper of your
   programs, and are useful in a debugging phase (identifying opcodes versus
   the mnemonic representation of instructions).

   The creation of listing files imposes much more processing work of the
   assembler. If you want to compile your code as quickly as possible then
   don't create listing files. Listing files obtain their file name from the
   base of the source filename, and is added with the 'lst' extension.

    5.3.4. -s : Create symbol table

   Symbol tables contains the integer form of symbolical names and constants
   that has been parsed and generated during a compilation of a source file.
   The structure of the symbol table is divided into two columns. The first
   contains the parsed symbol names, converted to uppercase. The second
   column contains the generated value of the symbol name.

   All symbol values are displayed in signed 32-bit hexadecimal notation.

   The two columns are separated by tabulators which represents a default
   value of 8 spaces per tabulator. The width of the symbol name column is
   defined as the tabulator distance multiplied by 4. The default width of
   the name column is 4 * 8 = 32 spaces.

   The symbol table will be written to the end of the appropriate listing
   file, if listing file and symbol table output is enabled. If no listing
   file output is enabled, the symbol table will be written to a separate
   file, identified with the base name of the source file module and given
   the 'sym' extension.

    5.3.5. -d : Assemble only updated files

   Assemblers usually force compiles all specified files. This is also
   possible (as default) for the [178]Z80 Module Assembler. In large
   application project with 15 modules or more it can be quite frustrating to
   compile all every time. The solution is to only assemble updated files and
   leave the rest (since they have been compiled to the programmers
   knowledge).

   But in a long term view it is better to just compile a project without
   thinking of which files need to be compiled or not. That can be done with
   the [179]Z80 Module Assembler. By simply specifying the [180]-d parameter
   at the command line, only updated source files are assembled into object
   files - the rest are ignored.

   Using the [181]-d option in combination with a project file gives the best
   project setup for a large compilation; compile your projects without
   worrying about which module is updated or not.

    5.3.6. -b : Link/relocate object files

   The [185]-b option must be used if you want to create an executable
   [186]Z80 machine code output file of your previously created object files.
   You may also use the [187]-a option which is identical in functionality
   but also includes the [188]-d option. In other words assemble only updated
   source modules and perform linking/relocation of the code afterwards.

     • Pass 1:
       When the linking process begins with the first object module, it is
       examined for an [189]ORG address to perform the absolute address
       relocation of all the object module machine code. The [190]ORG
       (loading address for memory) will have to be defined in the first
       source file module. If not, the assembler will prompt you for it on
       the command line. The [191]ORG address must be typed in hexadecimal
       notation. If you never use the [192]ORG directive in your source
       files, you can always explicitly define one at the command line with
       the [193]-r option.

       The next step in the linking process is loading of the machine code
       from each object module, in the order of the specified modules. Pass 1
       is completed with loading all local and global symbol definitions of
       the object modules. All relocatable address symbols are assigned the
       correct absolute memory location (based on [194]ORG ).

     • Pass 2:
       The address patching process. All expressions are now read and
       evaluated, then patched into the appropriate positions of the linked
       machine code.

       When all expressions have been evaluated the machine code is completed
       and saved to a file named as the first source file module, and
       assigned the 'bin' extension.

    5.3.9. -r<hex-address> : Re-define the ORG relocation address

   During the linking phase of the assembler the [206]ORG address that
   defines the position in memory where the code is to be loaded and
   executed, is fetched from the first object module file. You can override
   this by specifying an explicit address origin by entering the [207]-r
   option followed by an address in hexadecimal notation at the command line,
   e.g.:

 z80asm  [-b](#5_3_6)  -r4000 file.asm

   which specifies that your code is to be relocated for address 4000h
   (16384) onward.

   Using the [208]-r option supersedes a defined [209]ORG in the object file.
   You could for example have defined the [210]ORG to 8000h (32768) in your
   first source file, then compiled the project. This would have generated
   machine code for memory location 8000h (segment 2 in the Cambridge
   [211]Z88 ). Since the object files are generated it is easy to link them
   again with another [212]ORG address by just using the [213]-r option. The
   linking process does not alter the information in object files - they are
   only read. The same project could then easily be re-linked to another
   address, e.g.

 z80asm  [-b](#5_3_6)  -r2000 file.asm

    5.3.10. -R : Generate address independent code

   The [217]Z80 processor instruction set allows only relative jumps in
   maximum +/- 128 bytes using the JR and DJNZ instructions. Further, there
   is no program counter relative call-to-subroutine or jump-to-subroutine
   instruction. If you want a program to be address-independent no absolute
   address references may be used in jump or call instructions. If you want
   to program [218]Z80 address independent code you can only write small
   routines using the JR and DJNZ instructions. With a restricted interval of
   128 bytes you can imagine the size of those routines! Programming of large
   applications using address Independence is simply impossible on the
   [219]Z80 processor with the basic instruction set available. You can only
   define a fixed address origin ( [220]ORG ) for your machine code to be
   loaded and executed from. However, there is one solution: before the code
   is executed an automatic address-relocation is performed to the current
   position in memory. This is done only once. The penalty is that the
   program fills more space in memory. This is unavoidable since information
   must be available to define where the address relocation has to be
   performed in the program. Further, a small routine must be included with
   the program to read the relocation information and patch it into the
   specified locations of the program. It is impossible to determine the
   extra size generated with a relocation table. We assume an extra size of 3
   - 3.5K for a typical 16K application program.

   You can generate address independent code using the [221]-R option
   accompanied with the [222]-a or [223]-b option. There is no other
   requirements. The relocatable code may be useful for programmers using the
   Cambridge [224]Z88 who want to use machine code in the BBC BASIC
   application environment. This can easily be interfaced with the DIM
   statement to allocate memory for the machine code program, and issue a
   [225]CALL or USR() to execute the machine code.

   Please note that the linking process with the [226]-R option addresses
   your code from 0 onward. This is necessary when the runtime relocation is
   performed by the relocator (just before your program is executed). This
   can be examined by loading the address map file into a text editor.

   The principle of relocation is in fact a self-modifying program. You
   cannot relocate a program that has been blown into an EPROM (cannot be
   modified). You may only execute relocatable programs in dynamic memory
   (RAM).

   The relocator is built into the [227]Z80 Module Assembler. The relocation
   table is created during the linking phase. When all object modules have
   been linked and the appropriate machine code generated, the process is
   ended with first copying the relocator routine into the executable file,
   then a relocation table and finally the compiled machine code program. Any
   defined [228]ORG in your code is superseded - this is not necessary in a
   relocatable program!

   Two rules must be obeyed when using relocatable programs:

    1. The IY register must have been set up to point at the address where
       your program resides. The first code is in fact the relocator which
       manipulates your code on the basis of the IY register. If IY is not
       setup properly your machine code program will be relocated for an
       address it is not resided at. On execution your might then call a
       random address (on the basis of the random IY register).

    2. Don't use the alternate register set for parameter passing between the
       caller (of your code) in the main code and the relocated program. The
       following registers are affected by the initial relocation process:

 AFBCDEHL/IXIY/........ same
 ......../..../afbcdehl different

   You still have all the main registers for parameter passing which is more
   than sufficient for average programming.

   When your address-independent code is stored to the file, a message is
   displayed which informs the user of how many bytes the relocation header
   consists of. This constant is useful since it informs you of the distance
   between the relocation header and the start of your code. The map file
   automatically reflects the relocation header. All addresses of your code
   has been modified to include the relocation header. Please note that all
   addresses in the map file are defined from address 0. When your code is
   placed in an absolute memory address, and you need to perform a debugging
   session, you can find your specific label address by adding the constant
   from the map file to the memory origin of your code. The inbuilt relocator
   routine may be examined by extracting the "relocate.asm" file from the "
   [229]Z80 src.zip" compressed file resource.

    5.3.11. -g : Create global address definition file

   With this option it is possible to generate a [233]DEFC directive
   definition file of all globally declared identifiers in a file project
   (declared with the [234]XDEF directive). These global definitions are
   calculated from the specified [235]ORG address (from first module or the
   [236]-r option). This feature is very useful, if you want to get access to
   routines from a separate compilation. If the two code compilation were
   placed in different banks of the [237]Z88 , it would be possible to know
   the correct address of a routine just by using the [238]DEFC address
   definition previously compiled. We used this facility to access routines
   in the two 8K halves of the segment 0 debugged version. This debugger
   actually swaps one of the two 8K blocks in and out of segment 0 when
   needed to call an 'external' routine. Applications on the [239]Z88 may
   only access the upper 8K of segment 0. A 16K application therefore needs
   to be split in 8K halves and paged in when needed to be run in this area.

    5.3.13. @<project-file> :1.3.16. Using a project file

   Project files defines all file names of a project. The file name standard
   stored in a project file obeys the operating system notation.

   Instead of specifying every module file name at the command line, a simple
   reference of a project file can be made instead. According to the rules of
   the specification of parameters you specify either your source file
   modules or use a project file. The project file specification is of course
   much faster. An example:

 z80asm  [-a](#5_3_7)  main pass1 pass2 link asmdrctv z80instr

   This command line will compile all specified module file names into a
   single executable file called "main.bin". However if a project file
   'assembler' were created already containing the same file names, the
   command line would have been:

 z80asm  [-a](#5_3_7)  @assembler

   - much easier!

   A project file only contains file names. Each file name is separated by a
   newline character \n. The new line character may be different on various
   computer platforms - but the assembler interprets it correctly. The
   contents of a project file may look like this:

 z80asm
 z80pass1
 z80pass1
 modlink

   Project files are easily created using a simple text editor.

    5.3.14. -i<library-file> : Include library modules during linking/relocation

   This option allows compilation time linking of external machine code,
   better known as library routines. Much, much programming time can be saved
   by producing a set of standard routines compiled into library files. These
   may then be included later in application project compilations. The
   command line option allows specification of several library files. For
   each library reference in an application module, all library files will be
   scanned for that particular module. The filename (inclusive directory
   path) of the library may be specified explicitly on the command line
   immediately after the [250]-i identifier. If you omit the filename, a
   default library filename will be used by the assembler. This default
   filename is defined by creating the environment variable " [251]Z80
   _STDLIB=<library-file>. Please refer to your operating system
   documentation on how to create environment variables.

   Library files are recognised by the ".lib" extension.

    5.3.17. -x : Create a library

   A library file is composed of object files surrounded by a few file
   structures. The library file format (and object file format) may be found
   at the end of this documentation. A library is simply a set of independent
   routines (that may refer to each other) put together in a sequential form.
   You may only specify a single [262]-x option on the command line. A
   filename may be explicitly defined (including device and path information)
   to determine the storage location of the library. As in [263]-i you may
   omit the filename to use the default filename identified by the " [264]Z80
   _STDLIB" environment variable. A library routine must be defined using a
   simple [265]XLIB directive with an identical address name label
   definition. Please refer to further information later in this
   documentation. The " [266]Z80 lib.zip" contains the standard library with
   all corresponding source files. Have a look at them - they clearly
   displays how to compose a library routine.

   One very important aspect of libraries is the time that the assembler
   spends searching through them. To optimize the search you should place
   your routines in a "topological" order, i.e. routines that access other
   library routines should be placed first. In most situations you avoid
   redundant sequential searching through the library.

    5.3.18. -t<number> : Define tabulator distance for text output files

   To save storage space the [270]Z80 cross assembler output files (listing,
   map, symbol and [271]XDEF definition files) uses a tabulator control
   character instead of spaces. The benefit is about 30% compressed files.

   The tabulator distance defines the distance of space between each
   tabulator it represents. The default value is 8 spaces per tabulator.

   The tabulators are used to separate two columns of information. The first
   column contains a name of some sort. Since names have variable length, a
   size of the column is defined. The Assembler defines the size of the
   column by multiplying the current tabulator distance with 4, i.e. giving a
   default size of 4*8 = 32 'spaces'. This is usually more than enough for
   most name definitions parsed from source files.

   You may redefine the tabulator distance by using the [272]-t option
   immediately followed by a decimal number, e.g. -t4 for defining a
   tabulator distance of 4. The width of the first column will then be 4*4 =
   16 'spaces'.

   A compilation may be split into individual source files that either can be
   linked together during assembly as a single module or assembled as
   separate source file modules. Separate source file modules saves
   compilation time and memory. Further, this design is much more
   straightforward and much more logically clear in a design phase of a large

  5.9. Scope of symbols in source modules

   All source modules may refer to each others symbols by using [311]EXTERN
   directives. This means that you refer to external information outside the
   current source module. The opposite of an external module reference is to
   declare symbols globally available using a [312]PUBLIC directive, i.e.
   making symbols available to other source modules. Finally it is possible
   to have local symbols that are not known to other source modules than the
   current. A label or constant that has not been declared with [313]EXTERN ,
   [314]PUBLIC or [315]GLOBAL is local to the module.

  5.10. Using arithmetic and relational expressions

   All directives that require a numerical parameter or [319]Z80 mnemonics
   that use an integer argument may use expressions. Expressions may be
   formed by all standard arithmetic operators and relational operators. Even
   binary operators are implemented. All expressions may contain external
   identifiers and is automatically resolved during the linking phase. Only
   certain directives require compilation time evaluable expressions.

   [320](top) [321](keywords) [322](index)

  5.11. Source file manipulation

   To allow the Assembler to execute in multitasking environments such as
   LINUX and QDOS, all source input files are opened as shared I/O. This
   allows other programs to access the source files while the assembler is
   working. All output files (both text and binary files) are opened/created
   for exclusive use; other programs will have no access to those files until
   they have been closed.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [323](top) [324](keywords) [325](index)

  5.12. Free format of assembler source files

   The source files may be written in a free format. No fixed position
   columns as needed as in the COBOL programming language. All text may be
   typed in mixed case (the assembler converts all text input to uppercase).
   Tabulators may be used freely (instead of spaces which also saves source
   file space) to suit the programmers own habits of structured text layouts.
   However, one rule must be obeyed: syntax of [326]Z80 assembler mnemonics
   and most directives must be completed on individual lines. Text files
   using different OS dependant line feed standard are parsed properly; line
   feed types CR, LF or CRLF are automatically recognized. So you can easily
   compile your sources from Linux/UNIX on an MSDOS platform.

  5.13. Specification of filenames

   Specification of file names in source files are always enclosed in double
   quotes. The assembler just collects the filename string and uses this to
   open a file. This way all filename standards may be used as defined on
   different operating system platforms.

  5.14. Including other source files into the current source file

   The need for header file information such as operating system constants or
   data structures is often indispensable for source file modules. Instead of
   copying the contents of those files into each module, it is possible to
   include them at run time (during parsing). Infinite include file levels
   are permitted, i.e. included files calling other files.

   [333](top) [334](keywords) [335](index)

  5.15. Conditional assembly in source file modules

   Large compilation projects often need to compile the application in
   several variations. This can be achieved with enclosing parts of the
   source with conditional directives for the different variations of the
   application. This may also be useful if the assembler source is ported to
   several platforms, where inclusion of other source files (such as header
   files) are using different filename standards. The conditional directives
   [336]IF , [337]IFDEF , [338]IFNDEF , ELSE, and ENDIF may be nested into
   infinite levels.

   IM 2 interrupts must be disabled before they are executed (an interrupt
   may otherwise occur in the middle of the instruction execution). Many
   games on the ZX Spectrum have used them to protect the code from prying
   eyes. The [343]Z88 native debugger code uses some of the undocumented
   instructions for fast access to register variables.

   address origin, module name and machine code. The object file modules are
   much smaller than their source file counterparts (often smaller than 2K).

   information in the object files.

  5.19. Date stamp controlled assembly

   To avoid unnecessary compilation of source file modules, it is possible to
   let the assembler compile only recently updated source file modules by
   comparing the date stamp of the source and the object file modules. Source
   file modules that are older than object file modules are ignored. This
   facility is indispensable in large compilation projects.

  5.20. Listing files

   The assembler may generate listing files that contain a copy of the source
   file with additional code generation information of [358]Z80 mnemonics

   headers containing time of assembly and the filename. Line numbers are

   end of the listing file or as a separate symbol file. If the symbol table
   is dumped into the listing file, each symbol will be written with page
   references of all occurrences in the listing file. Address symbols
   (labels) are addressed relative to the start of the module. Symbol
   constants are written as defined in the source. The symbol table is
   written in alphabetical order with corresponding values in hexadecimal
   format.

  5.22. Linking and relocation of object modules into executable Z80 machine
  code

   To obtain an executable [365]Z80 machine code file it is necessary to link
   all assembled object modules and relocate them at a defined address, where
   the code is to be executed at in the computers' memory. The linking &
   relocation is performed automatically after completed assembly of all
   specified source file modules. The [366]ORG relocation address is

  5.23. Address map files

   The address map is invaluable information during a debugging session of
   your compiled program. This file contains all symbolical address labels
   with their generated address constants after a completed
   linking/relocation of all modules into executable machine code. The map
   file is ordered in two groups; the first list contains all symbol names
   ordered alphabetically with corresponding address constants, the second
   list contains all symbols ordered by their address value (in chronological
   order).

  5.24. Symbol address definition files

   As with address map files this contains information of globally declared
   symbolical address labels, relocated to their absolute position as for the
   compiled machine code file. However, the format is completely different;
   all symbols are created as constant definitions to be included as a header
   file into another source file and assembled. This is useful if you want to
   call subroutines compiled separately in another project (originated in a
   different memory setup).

  6.2. Running in the QDOS/SMSQ operating system environment

   z80asm may be compiled using the C68 compiler developed by the Walker
   brothers. You also need the 'env_bin' file. This is necessary to install
   into the operating system before using the assembler. It contains the
   environment variable facility integrated on UNIX, MS-DOS and many other
   operating systems. Include the following line into your BOOT upstart
   program:

 LRESPR win1_ext_env_bin

   The device and path 'win1_ext_' is just an example of where to store your
   system extension file. You may have it on your BOOT disk as well. If you
   don't have ToolKit 2 on your system use the following line in your BOOT
   program:

 envext=RESPR(1024):LBYTES win1_ext_env_bin,envext: [CALL](#10_2)  envext

   Use the following in your BOOT file to set the environment variables:

 SETENV "Z80_OZFILES=win1_z80_src_oz_"
 SETENV "Z80_STDLIB=win1_z80_standard_lib"

   The example file names are only a demonstration. Change them as necessary.

   This program can be executed on the LINUX operating system and any other

   described in Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie C books. The
   important thing to remember before compiling it under UNIX, is in which
   direction the integers are stored by the processor architecture; the
   famous Big Endian and Little endian concept. The config.h file uses a
   "ENDIAN" definition when z80asm must interpret integers in big endian
   order. Please set this definition according to your system's processor
   architecture. Most people uses the Intel processor when running Linux -
   this is a little endian architecture (so you don't need the ENDIAN
   define...).

   You can compile z80asm using GNU C compiler simply by entering the
   following on your command line:

 gcc  [-o](#5_3_8)  z80asm -O2 *.c

   The environment variables needed by z80asm are easily added in your
   accounts login script, ".profile" or ".bash_profile" in your home

  7.1. The assembler file types and their extension names

   The [403]Z80 Module Assembler uses several different filename extensions
   to distinguish the type of files processed. The base name of the source
   file is used to create the various assembler output file types. The
   following chapters explains the available files.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [404](top) [405](keywords) [406](index)

  7.2. The file name extension identifier

   The file name extension identifier may be different from platform to
   platform. UNIX has no defined standard. MSDOS and TOS uses '.'. QDOS uses
   the '_' identifier. SMSQ also allows the '.' extension identifier.

   The Assembler implemented on the supplied platforms is defined with the
   correct extension identifier. You can see this on the Assembler help page
   (executing the program with no parameters).

   [410](top) [411](keywords) [412](index)

    7.3.1. The source file extension, asm

   The extension for assembler mnemonic source files is 'asm'. Source files
   are specified by the user with or without the extension - whatever chosen,
   the assembler will investigate automatically what is needed to read the
   source files.

   You may override the default extension with the [413]-e option.

   [414](top) [415](keywords) [416](index)

    7.3.2. The object file extension, obj

   The extension for object files is 'obj'. The base file name is taken from
   the corresponding source file name. This file is generated by the
   assembler from parsing the source file and contains intermediate generated
   machine code, an address origin of the machine code, symbol information
   and expressions.

   You may override the default extension with the [417]-M option.

   [418](top) [419](keywords) [420](index)

    7.3.3. The error file extension, err

   The extension for error files is 'err'. Before beginning processing the
   source files, an error file is created. If any errors should occur, they
   will be written to this file containing information of where the error
   occurred. If no error were found, the error file is automatically closed
   and deleted.

   Error files are simple text files that can be loaded by any text editor
   for evaluation.

    7.3.4. The listing file extension, lst

   The extension for listing files is 'lst'. The base file name is taken from
   the corresponding source file name. This file is generated by the
   assembler and contains a hexadecimal output of the generated machine code
   that corresponds to the [424]Z80 mnemonic instruction or directive,
   followed by a copy of the original source line. If selected, the symbol
   table is dumped at the end of the listing file.

   [425](top) [426](keywords) [427](index)

    7.3.5. The symbol file extension, sym

   The extension for symbol table files is 'sym'. The base file name is taken
   from the corresponding source file name. The symbol table file contains
   information about the defined and used symbols of the source file and
   their generated values (labels and constants). The symbol file is only
   created if listing file output is disabled.

   [428](top) [429](keywords) [430](index)

    7.3.6. The executable file extension, bin

   The extension for executable [431]Z80 machine code files is 'bin'. The
   base file name is taken from the first specified source file name at the
   command line (or project file). This is the linked and relocated output of
   object files and may be executed by the [432]Z80 processor. You may
   override this default behaviour by using the [433]-o option and specify
   your own output filename (and extension).

    7.3.7. The address map file extension, map

   The extension for address map files is 'map'. The base file name is taken
   from the first specified source file name at the command line (or project
   file). This file is generated by the assembler and contains a list of all
   defined address labels from all linked/relocated modules with their
   calculated (absolute) address in memory.

   [438](top) [439](keywords) [440](index)

    7.3.8. The definition file extension, def

   The extension for global address label definition files is 'def'. The base
   file name is taken from the first specified source file name at the
   command line (or project file). This file is generated by the assembler
   and contains a list of all globally declared address labels with their
   calculated (absolute) origin address, fetched only during assembly of
   source file modules. The format of the list contains constant definitions
   (addresses) and may be parsed e.g. as include files for other projects.

    7.3.9. The library file extension, lib

   Library files are identified with the 'lib' extension. Library files may
   be created using the [444]-x option. Library may be included into
   application code during linking of object modules with the [445]-i option.

   [449](top) [450](keywords) [451](index)

  8.1. The assembler compiling process

   The [452]Z80 Module Assembler uses a two stage compilation process; stage
   1 parses source files and generates object files. Stage 2 reads the object
   files and links the object file code, completes with address patching and
   finishes with storing the executable code.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [453](top) [454](keywords) [455](index)

    8.1.1. Stage 1, parsing and code generation of all source files, object file
    generation

   A source file is being parsed for [456]Z80 mnemonics and directives. An
   object file is created to hold information of module name, local, global
   and external symbol identifiers, expressions and the intermediate code
   generation (but address and other constant information). During pass 1 all
   [457]Z80 mnemonics are parsed and code is generated appropriately. All
   expressions are evaluated; expressions that contain relocatable address
   symbols or external symbol are automatically stored into the object file.
   Expressions that didn't evaluate are preserved for pass 2. When a source
   file has been read successfully to the end, pass 2 is started. During pass
   2 all non-evaluated expressions from pass 1 are re-evaluated and stored to
   the object file if necessary. Errors are reported if symbols are still
   missing in expressions. When all expressions are evaluated and no errors
   occurred, all "touched" symbols (used in expressions) are stored into the
   object file, with scope, type and value. Then, the module name and
   generated code is stored to the object file. Various file pointers to
   sub-sections of the object file is resolved. The completion of stage 1 is
   to produce the symbol table output (either appended to listing file if
   selected or as a separate file).

   This process is performed for all specified source modules in a project.

   [458](top) [459](keywords) [460](index)

    8.1.2. Stage 2, linking object files and library modules, producing
    executable code

   Pass 1 of the linking loads information from each object file in the
   project; the [461]ORG address is fetched, identifiers (resolving scope,
   and absolute values) loaded, and machine code linked. During this pass all
   external library modules are fetched and linked with the object modules
   (if a library is specified from the command line). When all modules have
   been loaded, pass 2 begins. Pass 2 then reads each expression section from
   all object modules (including library modules), evaluates them and patches
   the value into the appropriate position of the linked machine code. When
   all expressions have been evaluated successfully the executable code is
   stored. If selected, the address map file is produced from the current
   symbol table resided in the data structures of the assembler's memory is
   stored to a text file.

  8.2. File names

   Specification of file names follows the convention used on the various
   platforms that the assembler is ported to. Please read your operating
   systems manual for more information.

  8.3. Portability of assembler file names

   If you are going to port your [468]Z80 Module Assembler files across
   several platforms a few hints may be worth considering:

   Avoid special symbols in file names like '_', '#' and '.' . They may have
   special meaning on some operating system platforms. Use only 7-bit
   standard ASCII letters in file names ('A' to 'z'). Non English language
   letters are not always allowed, and further they may not be interpreted
   correctly when ported to another platform. Avoid too long file names. Some
   operating systems have boundaries for length of filenames in a directory
   path. For example MS-DOS only allows 8 characters in a file name (followed
   by an extension). Others may have no boundaries.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [469](top) [470](keywords) [471](index)

  8.4. Source file structure

   The composition of a source file module is completely free to the
   programmer. How he chooses to place the source code on a text line has no
   effect of the parsing process of the assembler. The linefeed
   interpretation is also handled by z80asm - it understands the following
   formats:

     • <LF> (used by QDOS/SMSQ/UNIX/AMIGA);
     • <CR><LF> (used by MSDOS);
     • <CR> (used by [472]Z88 /MacIntosh).

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [473](top) [474](keywords) [475](index)

  8.5. Using local, global and external symbols

   In larger application projects it is unavoidable to use a modular
   programming design, i.e. splitting the source into several individual
   files. This approaches the popular top - down design where you can isolate
   the problem solving into single modules. The outside world just needs to
   know where the routine is to be called by linking the modules with a few
   directives.

   In the [476]Z80 Module Assembler you only need two directives to
   accomplish just that: the [477]XREF and [478]XDEF directives.

   [479]XREF declares a symbol to be external to the current source file
   module. This tells the assembler that all expressions using that symbol is
   not to be evaluated until the compiled object modules are to linked and
   relocated together. An expression that contains this symbol is simply
   stored into the object file.

   [480]XDEF declares a symbol to be created in this module and made globally
   available to other modules during the linking/relocation phase. All
   expressions that contain a globally declared symbol is automatically
   stored into the object file.

   When a symbol is created and is neither declared external or global, it is
   implicitly defined as local to the current source module. The symbol is
   then only available to the current module during linking/relocation.

   If you want to access (external) library modules from a library, use the
   [481]LIB directive followed by the name of the routine. Several routine
   names may be specified separated by a comma.

   During the linking process all external and corresponding global symbols
   are resolved. If two identical global identifiers are loaded by the
   linking process, the most recently loaded identifier is used by the
   linker.

   [482](top) [483](keywords) [484](index)

  8.6. Defining symbol names

   Good programming involves a structured approach to mnemonic identification
   of names in subroutines, variables, data structures and other constants.
   The [485]Z80 Module Assembler gives you several possibilities. The easiest
   and frequently used one is [486]DEFC (Define Constant). We have supplied a
   complete set of header files (the "OZdefc.zip" file) containing the
   [487]Z88 operating system manifests as defined in the Developers' Notes V3
   (the "devnotes.zip" file) which just contains [488]DEFC directives.

   Each [489]DEFC directive is followed by an identifier name, followed by a
   = symbol and then an evaluable constant expression (usually just a
   constant). Constant definitions are usually operating system manifest or
   other frequently used items. They are put into separate source files and
   later inserted into main source files using the [490]INCLUDE directive.

   Though [491]DEFC resolves most needs, it may be necessary to define
   variable areas or templates containing names with an appropriate size tag
   (byte, word or double word). This is possible using the [492]DEFVARS
   directive. Here you may specify as many names as needed in the group.
   Then, it is easy to add, rearrange or delete any of the variable names -
   only a few modifications and then just re-compiling the necessary source
   files that use the templates. This would be a nightmare with [493]DEFC ,
   since you have to keep track of the previous and next name in the group in
   addition to count the size of all names. All this is managed by
   [494]DEFVARS automatically. Have a look at the syntax in the Directive
   Reference section.

   With advanced [495]Z80 programming you cannot avoid dynamic data
   structures like linked lists or binary trees. The fundamentals for this
   are known as records in PASCAL or structures in C. [496]DEFVARS is well
   suited for this purpose. Defining each [497]DEFVARS group with 0
   automatically generates offset variables. The last name then automatically
   defines the size of the data structure. Again, refer to the directive
   reference for a good example.

   A third possibility for an easy definition of symbols is to use the
   [498]DEFGROUP directive. Here you're able to define a set of symbols equal
   to an enumeration. It follows the same principles as for C's ENUM
   facility. The default starts at 0 and increases by 1. If you choose, a
   specific identifier may be set to a value, which then can set the next
   enumeration sequence. Again, this directive has been made to implement an
   easy way of defining symbols and providing a simple method to alter the
   identifier group. Please refer to the directive reference for an example.

  8.7. Comments in source files

   As always, good programming requires good documentation. Without comments
   your programs lose overview and logic. Machine code is especially hard to
   follow - have you tried to look at a piece of code 2 years after
   implementation AND without any comments? HORRIBLE! There is never too many
   comments in machine code - we especially like to use high level language
   as comments - it avoids unnecessary text and logic is much more clear.

   Comments in [502]Z80 source files are possible using a semicolon. When the
   assembler meets a semicolon the rest of the current source line is ignored
   until the linefeed. Parsing will then commence from the beginning of the
   line. The semicolon may be placed anywhere in a source line. As stated you
   cannot place mnemonics after the semicolon - they will be ignored. The
   [503]Z80 parser will in many places accept comments without a semicolon
   has been set - but don't rely on it. Better use a semicolon. The context
   is much clearer. The following is an example on how to use comments in
   [504]Z80 source files:

 ; **********************
 ; main menu
 ;
 .mainmenu   call window   ; display menu
             call getkey   ; read keyboard
             ret           ; action in register A

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [505](top) [506](keywords) [507](index)

  8.8. Defining symbolic address labels

   The main reason for using an assembler is to be able to determine
   symbolical addresses and use them as reference in the code. These are
   defined by a name preceded with a full stop, or followed by a colon. It is
   allowed to place a mnemonic or directive after an address label. An
   address label may be left as a single statement on a line - you may of
   course use comment after the label. The following is a label definition:

 ; *****************
 ; routine definition
 .mainmenu call xxx   ; a label is preceded with '.'
 endmain:  ret                ; or followed by ':'

   It is not allowed to position two labels on the same line. However, you
   may place as many label after each other - even though no code is between
   them. They just receive the same assembler address.

   It is not allowed to specify two identical address labels in the same
   source file.

   If you want to declare an address globally accessible to other modules,
   then use [508]PUBLIC for the address label definition, otherwise the label
   definition will be interpreted as a local address label.

  [PUBLIC](#10_26)  mainmenu
 ...
 .mainmenu ; label accessible from other modules with  [EXTERN](#10_12)

   You may use before or after the label - z80asm automatically handles the
   scope resolution as long as you use [509]PUBLIC to define it as globally
   accessible.

  8.9. Writing Z80 mnemonic instructions

   All [513]Z80 instructions may be written in mixed case, lower or upper
   case - you decide! How you separate opcode words, register names and
   operands is your choice. Only a few rules must be obeyed:

    1. Each instruction mnemonic must be completed on a single line.
    2. The instruction identifier must be a word, i.e. don't use space
       between [514]CALL .
    3. Register identifiers must be a word, ie. HL not H L.

   A few examples which all are legal syntax:

 Ld HL   , 0       ; comment
 ld       hl, $fFFF;comment
 caLL ttttt

  8.10. Optional Z80 mnemonic instruction syntax

   The instructions below allow additional specification of the accumulator
   register. Zilog standard convention is to only specify the source operand.
   Sometimes it is better to specify the accumulator to make the instruction
   look more clear, and to avoid confusion. After all, they specified it for
   "add", "adc" and "sbc".

 sub a,r
 sub a,n
 sub a,(hl)
 sub a,(ix+0)
 sub a,(iy+0)

   this syntax applies also to "and", "or", "xor" & "cp"

  8.11. The undocumented Z80 instructions

   We have included the parsing and code generation of the undocumented
   [521]Z80 instructions. They are as follows:

 LD   r,IXL  ; r = A,B,C,D,E,IXL,IXH
 LD   r,IXH
 LD   IXL,n  ; n = 8-bit operand
 LD   IXH,n

 ADC  A,IXL
 ADC  A,IXH
 ADD, AND, CP, DEC, INC, OR, SBC, SUB, XOR ...

 SLL  r   ; r = A,B,C,D,E,H,L
 SLL  (HL)
 SLL  (IX+d)
 SLL  (IY+d)

   SLL (Shift Logical Left)

   SLL does shift leftwards but insert a '1' in bit 0 instead of a '0'.

   Except for the SLL instruction all have bugs related to an interrupt being
   able to occur while the instructions are decoded by the processor. They
   are implemented on the chip, but are reported to be unreliable. We have
   used some of them in our debugger software for the [522]Z88 . Until now
   the code has been running successfully on all our [523]Z88 computers.

  8.12. Referencing library routines

   When you need to use a library routine in your application code, you need
   to do two things; include a library file at the assembler command line
   with the [527]-i option and refer to the library routine in your source
   file using the [528]LIB directive followed by the name of the library
   routine, e.g.

  [LIB](#10_20)  malloc, free

   which will declare the two names "malloc" and "free" as external
   identifiers to the current source file module. Please note that you can
   declare the names before or after they actually are referred in your
   program source,. Failing to use the [529]LIB directive will interpret
   labels as local symbols to that source file module. When the parser meets
   the instruction that uses one of the above names in a parameter, the
   parameter "expression" is automatically saved to the object file for later
   processing.

   During the linking phase of all the object files the specified library
   file is automatically scanned for "malloc" and "free" and included into
   the application code when found.

   Much application programming can be saved in "re-inventing the wheel" if
   you store frequently used standard routines in libraries. We have supplied
   a comprehensive set of library routines that were created along the
   development of the Assembler Workbench application EPROM. Use them as
   appropriate and add new ones. We are interested in your work - if you feel
   that you have made some good routines that others may benefit from, e-mail
   them to us and we will include them into the standard library.

  8.13. Creating/updating libraries

   Creating libraries is an inbuilt feature of the assembler. The following
   steps are necessary to create a library:

    1. Define a project file containing all filenames (without extensions) in
       your directory that contains all library routines (the easiest method
       since you later can move all files to another directory). Remember to
       arrange the filename in a topological order, i.e. library routines
       that access other routines must be placed first. This optimizes the
       searching through a library during the linking process.

    2. Each library source module uses the [533]XLIB directive to define the
       name of the routine. The same name must be used for the address label
       definition. If your library uses other library routines then declare
       them with the [534]LIB directive. Please note that a library routine
       creates the module name itself (performed by [535]XLIB automatically).
       The module name is used to search for routines in a library.

    3. The command line contains the [536]-x option immediately followed by
       your filename. If you don't specify a filename, the default standard
       filename is used (defined by the [537]Z80 _STDLIB environment
       variable). Then you need to specify your project filename preceded by
       '@'.

   For example:

 z80asm -xiofunctions @iofunctions

   will create a library "iofunctions.lib" in the current directory (also
   containing all library source files). The project file is "iofunctions"
   also in the current directory.

   Please note that no binary file is created (a library is NOT an executable
   file), but a collection of object files sequentially organized in a file.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  8.14. Referencing routines in other compiled projects

   It may be necessary in some situations to get access to routines
   previously compiled in another project. This implies however a knowledge
   of their absolute addresses during linking. This information is stored in
   the map file, but not accessible in a form suitable to be parsed by the
   assembler. However, this is possible in using the [541]-g option at the
   assembler command line. The action performed creates a [542]DEFC list file
   of address labels that have been declared as globally available (using the
   [543]XDEF directive). Only compiled source files are included in the list.
   If you were using the [544]-a option (compile only updated source files)
   and no files were updated then the [545]-g file would be empty. If you
   would like a complete list of all global routines then it is needed to
   compile the whole project (using the [546]-b command line option).

   When the file is generated, it can easily be [547]INCLUDE 'd in another
   project where your routines may access the external routines. You might do
   this in two ways:

    1. Including the file in every source module that needs to access
       external routines. This may be the easiest solution if you're only
       going to need external access in one or two source modules. With many
       external calls in different module of the current project it requires
       much altering of files.

    2. Creating a new source file that is part of your project. This file
       could easily be the first file in your project but could just as well
       be placed anywhere in your project. Declare each external name that is
       needed somewhere in your project as [548]XDEF , meaning that all names
       to be included are globally accessible from this module. Then specify
       the [549]INCLUDE of the [550]DEFC list of the other project file. As
       the names get loaded, they become global definitions. All other
       definitions will be ignored and not stored to the object file (they
       are not referred in the source module). All other modules just need to
       specify the external names as [551]XREF . During linking they all get
       resolved and your code has access to external routines from a
       previously compiled project.

   Whenever the previous project has been re-compiled (and issued with
   [552]-g option) there is a possibility that routine addresses has changed.
   You therefore need to recompile the extra source module in your project to
   get the new identifier values - the rest of your compilation is unaffected
   (due to the [553]XREF directives). Only the linking process gets the new
   proper addresses. In example 1) you had to recompile all source files that
   would have used an [554]INCLUDE of the [555]DEFC list file. In example 2)
   only one file had to be recompiled.

   The principle of external addresses was used to compile the debugger
   version to be resided in segment 0 (into the upper 8K). The actual size of
   the debugger code uses 16K, but was split into two separate halves to fit
   into the upper 8K of segment 0. Each of the 8K code-segments had to get
   access to the other 8K block. The solution was the [556]-g option and
   cross referencing using [557]XREF and an additional source module
   (containing the [558]XDEF declarations) that included the [559]-g list
   file of the other project compilation.

9. Using expressions

   Expressions are almost unavoidable in source files. They define and
   explain things much clearer than just using a constant. The [563]Z80
   Module Assembler allows expressions wherever a parameter is needed. This
   applies to [564]Z80 mnemonic instructions, directives and even in
   character strings. The resulting value from an evaluated expression is
   always an integer. All expressions are calculated internally as 32-bit
   signed integers. However, the parameter type defines the true range of the
   expression. E.g. you cannot store a 32-bit signed integer at an 8-bit LD
   instruction like LD A, <n> . If a parameter is outside an allowed integer
   range an assembly error is reported. Finally, no floating point operations
   are needed by the assembler. There is no real standard on [565]Z80 based
   computers.

   Whenever an integer is stored in a [566]Z80 file, the standard Zilog
   notation is used, i.e. storing the integer in low byte, high byte order
   (this also applies to 32-bit integers). This standard is also known as
   little endian notation (also used by INTEL processors).

   Expressions may be formed as arithmetic and relational expressions.
   Several components are supported: symbol names (identifiers), constants,
   ASCII characters and various arithmetic operators.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [567](top) [568](keywords) [569](index)

  9.1. Constant identifiers

   Apart from specifying decimal integer numbers, you are allowed to use
   hexadecimal constants, binary constants and ASCII characters. The
   following symbols are put in front of the constant to identify the type:

 $ : hexadecimal constant, e.g. $4000 (16384).
 @ : binary constant, e.g. @11000000 (192).
 ' ' : ASCII character, e.g. 'a'.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [570](top) [571](keywords) [572](index)

  9.2. Arithmetic operators

   All basic arithmetic operators are supported: addition, subtraction,
   multiplication, division and modulus. In addition binary logical operators
   are implemented: binary AND, OR and XOR.

 + : addition, e.g. 12+13
 - : unary minus, subtraction. e.g. -10, 12-45
 * : multiplication, e.g. 45*2 (90)
 / : division, e.g. 256/8 (32)
 % : modulus, e.g. 256%8 (0)
 ** : power, e.g. 2**7 (128)
 & : binary AND, e.g. 255 & 7 (7)
 | : binary OR, e.g. 128 | 64 (192)
 ^ : binary XOR, e.g. 128 ^ 128 (0)
 ~ : binary NOT, e.g. (~0xAA) & 0xFF (0x55)

   Arithmetic operators use the standard operator precedence, shown from
   highest to lowest:

 constant identifiers
 () ** */% +-&|^~

   If you want to override the default operator precedence rules, use
   brackets ().

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [573](top) [574](keywords) [575](index)

  9.3. Relational operators

   With relational operators you may form logical expressions resulting in
   true or false conditions. The resulting value of a true expression is 1.
   The resulting value of a false expression is 0. These operators are quite
   handy when you need to perform complex logic for conditional assembly in
   [576]IF -ELSE-ENDIF statements. The following relational operators are
   available:

 = : equal to
 <> :not equal to
 < : less than
 > : larger than
 <= : less than or equal to
 >= : larger than or equal to
 ! : not

   You may link several relational expressions with the binary operators AND,
   OR and XOR. You have all the possibilities available!

   It is perfectly legal to use relational expressions in parameters
   requiring an arithmetic value. For example:

 LD A, (USING_IBM = 1) | RTMFLAGS

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  9.4. The ASMPC standard function

   In occasional circumstances it may be necessary to use the current
   location of the assembler program counter in an expression e.g.
   calculating a relative distance. This may be done with the help of the
   ASMPC identifier. An example:

 .errmsg0  [DEFB](#10_3)  errmsg1 - ASMPC - 1 , "File open error"
 .errmsg1  [DEFB](#10_3)  errmsg2 - ASMPC - 1 , "Syntax error"
 .errmsg2

   Here, a length byte of the following string (excluding the length byte) is
   calculated by using the current ASMPC address value.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   [580](top) [581](keywords) [582](index)

  9.5. Symbol identifiers in expressions

   Apart from using integer constants in your expressions, names are allowed
   as well. This is frequently used for symbolical address label references
   (both external and local).

   Forward referencing of symbols is not really something that is important
   in evaluating expressions. The logic is built into the assembler parser.
   If an expression cannot be resolved in pass 1 of source file parsing, it
   will try to re-evaluate the failed expression in pass 2 of the parsing. If
   it still fails a symbol has not been found ( [583]XREF and [584]LIB
   external symbols are handled during the linking phase).

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

10. Directive reference

   The [588]Z80 Module Assembler directives are used to manipulate the
   [589]Z80 assembler mnemonics and to generate data structures, variables
   and constants. You are even permitted to include binary files while code
   generation is performed.

   As the name imply they direct the assembler to perform other tasks than
   just parsing and compiling [590]Z80 instruction mnemonics. All directives
   are treated as mnemonics by the assembler, i.e. it is necessary that they
   appear as the first command identifier on the source line (NOT necessarily
   the first character). Only one directive is allowed at a single source
   line. Even though they are written as CAPITALS in this documentation they
   may be written in mixed case letters in your source files.

   Since the directives cover very different topics of assembler processing,
   each directive will be explained in detail, identified with a header
   description for each text section. The following syntax is used:

 <> : defines an entity, i.e. a number, character or string.
 {} : defines a an optional repetition of an entity.
 [] : defines an option that may be left out.

  10.1. BINARY "filename"

   [594]BINARY loads a binary file at the current location. This could for

   The <expression> may be a 16-bit expression and must evaluate to a

   This is an advanced RST 20H instruction which automatically allocates
   space for the size of the specified parameter (either 8-bit or 16-bit).
   Code is internally generated as follows:

 RST $20
  [DEFB](#10_3)  x ; 8-bit parameter

   or

 RST $20
  [DEFW](#10_4)  x ; 16-bit parameter

   Define a symbol variable, that may either be a constant or an expression

   value. All standard [611]Z88 operating system header files use [612]DEFC

  10.7. DEFM <string expression>|<8-bit expr>,...

   [616]DEFM stores a string constant at the current location. Strings are
   enclosed in double quotes, e.g. "abcdefgh". Strings may be concatenated
   with byte constants using commas. This is useful if control characters
   need to be a part of the string and cannot be typed from the keyboard.
   Several strings and byte expressions may be concatenated, e.g.

  [DEFM](#10_7)  "string_a" , "string_b" , 'X' , CR , LF , 0

  10.8. DEFGROUP '{' name {',' name ['=' <8-bit expression>]} '}'

   [620]DEFGROUP defines a group of identifier symbols with implicit values.
   This is similar to the enumeration principles used in C and PASCAL. The
   initial symbol value is 0, increased by 1 for each new symbol in the list.
   You may include a <name = expression> which breaks the linear enumeration
   from that constant. The [621]DEFGROUP directive may be spanned across
   several lines and MUST be enclosed with { and }. [622]DEFGROUP is just a
   more easy way than: [623]DEFC name0 = 0, name1 = name0, ...

   The following example illustrates a useful example of defining symbol
   values:

  [DEFGROUP](#10_8)
 {
    sym_null
    sym_ten = 10, sym_eleven, sym_twelve
 }

   expressions need to be constants.

  10.11. DEFVARS <16-bit expression> '{' [<name>] [<storage_size>
  <size_multiplier>] '}'

   [634]DEFVARS defines variable address area or offsets. First you define
   the origin of a variable area. This may be defined using an evaluable
   16-bit positive expression. Each variable name is followed by a size
   specifier which can be 'ds.b' (byte), 'ds.w' (word), 'ds.p' (3-byte
   pointer) or 'ds.l' (double-word). This is particularly useful for defining
   dynamic data structures in linked lists and binary search trees. Defining
   variable areas are only template definitions not allocations. An example:

  [DEFVARS](#10_11)   [Z80](#7) asm_vars
 {
    RuntimeFlags1 ds.b 1     ; reserve 1 byte
    RuntimeFlags2 ds.b 1
    RuntimeFlags3 ds.b 1
                  ds.w 1     ; space not named
    explicitORIG  ds.w 1     ; reserve 2 bytes
    asmtime       ds.b 3     ; reserve 3 bytes
    datestamp_src ds.b 6     ; reserve 6 bytes
    datestamp_obj ds.b 6
    TOTALERRORS   ds.l 1     ; reserve 4 bytes
 }

   the following is useful for defining dynamic data structures:

  [DEFVARS](#10_11)  0                    ; 'PfixStack' structure
 {
    pfixstack_const     ds.l 1    ; stack item value
    pfixstack_previtem  ds.p 1    ; pointer to previous
    SIZEOF_pfixstack              ; size of structure
 }

   This type of variable declaration makes it very easy for modifications,
   e.g. deleting or inserting variable definitions.

   A special logic is available too which can be used throughout individual
   source files during compilation. If you specify -1 as the starting
   address, the last offset from the previous [635]DEFVARS which was not
   specified as 0 will be used.

   This enables you to gradually build up a list of identifier name offsets
   across [636]DEFVARS areas in different source files. The following example
   explains everything:

 defvars $4000
 {
    aaa ds.b 1
    bbb ds.b 100
 }
 defvars -1
 {
    ccc ds.b 100
    ddd ds.b 1
    eee ds.b 10
 }
 defvars 0
 {
    fff ds.p 1
    ggg ds.b 1
    hhh ds.w 1
    iii ds.p 1
 }
 defvars -1
 {
    jjj ds.b 100

 }

   Some of the symbols will look like this:

 BBB = $4001
 CCC = $4065
 GGG = $0003
 JJJ = $40D4

  10.18. INCLUDE "filename"

   Another component that is frequently used is to 'link' an additional
   source file together with the current source file. Usually this contains
   variable definitions that are commonly used by several modules in a
   project. This makes sense since there is no idea in copying the same
   information into several files - it simply uses redundant space of your
   storage media. This is certainly important on the [664]Z88 which not
   always has huge amounts of installed user/system RAM (usually 128K). The
   external source file will be included at the position of the [665]INCLUDE
   directive.

   The format of the filename depends on the operating system platform. As
   with the current source file, you may also insert files in include files.
   There is no limit of how many levels (of files) you specify of include
   files. Recursive or mutually recursive [666]INCLUDE files (an [667]INCLUDE
   file calling itself) is not possible - the assembler program will
   immediately return an error message back to you!

   Include files are usually put at the start of the source file module but
   may be placed anywhere in the source text. The current source file will be
   continued after the [668]INCLUDE directive when the included file has been
   parsed to the end of file.

   routines in libraries. Further, it allows the programmer to choose a
   well-defined name for the source file module. The position of the module
   name is of no importance; it may be placed at the end or the start of the
   source file. However, it has more sense to put it at the top. The syntax

11. Run time error messages

   The following error messages will be written toe the error files
   corresponding to each source file, and also to stderr. Each error message
   will contain the name of the source file and a line number where the error
   occurred in the file.

     • "File open/read error"
       You have tried to access a file that either was not found, already
       opened by other resources, or the assembler wasn't able to create
       output files (object file, listing-, symbol-, map- or executable
       binary file).

     • "Syntax error"
       This is a message used by many routines - hence the general but
       descriptive message. You have tried to use illegal registers in
       [724]Z80 mnemonic instructions, specified an illegal parameter type
       (string instead of integer), omitted a parameter ( [725]DEFB without
       constant).

     • "Symbol not defined"
       This error is given if you are referring to an identifier (usually in
       an address reference) that was not declared. Either a label definition
       is missing in the current module or you have forgotten to declare an
       identifier as external using the [726]XREF directive.

     • "Not enough memory" / "No room in [727]Z88 "
       Well, well. It seems that there wasn't enough room to hold the
       internal data structures during parsing or linking your code. Delete
       any unnecessary running applications/jobs then try again. If you got
       the message on the [728]Z88 , try also to delete unnecessary files
       from the filing system of your current RAM card.

     • "Integer out of range"
       You have an expression which evaluates into a constant that are beyond
       the legal integer range (e.g. trying to store a 16-bit value into an
       8-bit parameter).

     • "Syntax error in expression"
       Quite clearly you have made an illegal expression, e.g. specifying two
       following operands without an operator to separate them, used an
       illegal constant specifier or using illegal characters that aren't a
       legal identifier.

     • "Right bracket missing"
       Your expression is using brackets and is not properly balanced, i.e.
       too many beginning brackets or too few ending brackets.

     • "Source filename missing"
       There has not been specified any source file modules or project file
       to start a compilation.

     • "Illegal option"
       The command line parser couldn't recognise the -option. Remember to
       specify your option in EXACT case size. You have probably used a space
       between an option and a filename parameter.

     • "Unknown identifier"
       The parser expected a legal identifier, i.e. a directive or [729]Z80
       mnemonic. You have probably omitted the '.' in front of a label
       definition, misspelled a name or used a comment without a leading ';'.

     • "Illegal identifier"
       You have been trying to use a name that is either not known to the
       parser or an illegal identifier. This might happen if you try to use a
       register that is not allowed in a LD instruction, e.g. LD A,F .

     • "Max. code size reached"
       Is that really possible? Very interesting code of yours! [730]Z80
       machine code program tend to be in the 32K range (at least on the
       [731]Z88 )... Well, the [732]Z80 processor cannot address more than
       64K. Start changing your code to a smaller size!

     • "errors occurred during assembly"
       Status error message displayed on the screen when the assembler has
       completed its parsing on all modules. You have one or more errors to
       correct in your source files before the assembler continues with
       linking the next time.

     • "Symbol already defined"
       In the current source file, you have tried to create two identical
       address label definitions, or other name identifier creators (using
       [733]DEFC , [734]DEFVARS , [735]DEFGROUP ).

     • "Module name already defined"
       You have used the [736]MODULE directive more than once in your source
       file, or used both a [737]MODULE and [738]XLIB directive (library
       modules only need an [739]XLIB ).

     • "Symbol already declared local"
       You have tried to declare a symbol as [740]XREF , but it was already
       defined local, eg. using a ".lbaddr" in your source.

     • "Illegal source filename"
       You have tried to specify an option after having begun to specify
       filenames. Options must always be specified before filenames or
       project files.

     • "Symbol declared global in another module"
       You have two identical [741]XDEF definitions in separate modules. One
       of them should probably be an [742]XREF instead.

     • "Re-declaration not allowed"
       You are trying to specify an [743]XDEF for a name that has already
       been [744]XREF 'ed in the same module (or the other way around).

     • " [745]ORG already defined"
       Only one [746]ORG statement is allowed per section.

     • "Relative jump address must be local"
       You have tried to JR to a label address that is declared as external
       (with [747]XREF or [748]LIB ). JR must be performed in the current
       source file module.

     • "Not a relocatable file" / "Not an object file"
       The assembler opened a supposed object file (with the proper ".obj"
       extension) but realised it wasn't conforming to the [749]Z80 assembler
       standard object file format.

     • "Couldn't open library file"
       The library file was found but couldn't be opened (probably already
       opened by another application resource)

     • "Not a library file"
       Your library file is not a library file (at least is not of the
       correct file format used by this assembler). Have you maybe used
       another "library" file? The [750]Z80 library file could also be
       corrupted (at least in the header).

     • "Environment variable not defined"
       The assembler reports either the " [751]Z80 _STDLIB" environment
       variable wasn't found when used by options [752]-x and [753]-i .

     • "Cannot include file recursively"
       A file was tried to be included which was already included at a
       previous include level. [754]INCLUDE "a.h" cannot contain an
       [755]INCLUDE "a.h".
